Code a numerical 2 if the person or people who are fasting is a woman or group of women. You may use clues from the text; for instance, if there is a mention of a fasterâ€™s reduced milk supply for breastfeeding due to fasting, then code 2. Code a numerical 3 if the fasting mentioned in the paragraph applies to both men and women or the context makes it clear that both genders fast. Code a numerical 0 if the gender of the people or persons fasting is left unclear in the paragraph. If the text uses male pronouns for a specific person, code 1, and if the text uses female pronouns for a specific person, code 2. If the texts uses male pronouns, but it is not for a specific person, then code 0. If male pronouns are the only evidence that the faster is a man or a group of men, then code 0. Please do not provide any other information in your response. Here is the paragraph:"
