Project:
Generating Units of Cultural Analysis with Large Language Models: Benchmarking GPT-4 on Ethnographic Texts about Ritual Fasting from 56 Societies
We evaluate GPT-4â€™s ability to generate binary codes from ethnographic texts on ritual fasting, comparing its outputs to a human consensus subset (n = 225) and to annotations from two independent
coders on a larger dataset (n = 1,015).
